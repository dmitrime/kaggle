Merck
======

Scripts from the Merck competition in which I placed 16th with an ensemble of GBM models.
Each GBM model was trained on a different set of features sampled randomly from a pool of good features, then used to predict each of the 15 ACT sets.
In total about 32 + 32 + 2 models were trained (all 3 sets used different gbm parameters), then averaged with equal weights.
